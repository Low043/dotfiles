# Project Context: Dotfiles

This repository contains personal configuration files (dotfiles) for an Arch Linux system, managed using **GNU Stow**. It automates the setup of the window manager, terminal, shell, and other tools.

## System Overview

*   **OS:** Arch Linux
*   **Window Manager:** Hyprland
*   **Terminal:** Kitty
*   **Shell:** Zsh (Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k)
*   **Package Manager:** Pacman / Yay (AUR)
*   **Config Manager:** GNU Stow

## Directory Structure & Components

The repository is organized into "packages" (directories) that Stow manages. Each directory mirrors the structure of the user's `$HOME`.

*   **`hypr/`**: Configuration for the Hyprland Window Manager (`.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`).
*   **`kitty/`**: Configuration for the Kitty terminal (`.config/kitty/kitty.conf`).
*   **`zsh/`**: Zsh configuration. Contains `.zshrc` (linked to `~/.zshrc`) which sets up Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k.
*   **`install.sh`**: Automation script to install system dependencies.
*   **`packages.txt`**: List of required packages (official and AUR) used by `install.sh`.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Installation
The `install.sh` script handles the bootstrapping process. It checks for the `yay` AUR helper (installing it if missing) and installs all packages listed in `packages.txt`.

```bash
./install.sh
```

### 2. Linking Configurations
Use GNU Stow to symlink configurations from this repository to the home directory.

```bash
# Apply a specific configuration (e.g., zsh)
stow zsh

# Apply all configurations
stow *
```

### 3. Adding New Dependencies
When adding a new tool or configuration that requires specific software:
1.  Add the package name to `packages.txt`.
2.  Commit the change to ensure the setup remains reproducible.

## Development Conventions

*   **Language:** 
    *   **Communication:** Interactions with AI agents and developers should be in **Portuguese**.
    *   **Artifacts:** All code, comments, documentation (README, GEMINI.md), and scripts must be in **English**.
*   **Package Management:** Always add new system dependencies to `packages.txt` instead of installing them manually, to maintain reproducibility.
*   **Stow Pattern:** Follow the GNU Stow pattern where the top-level directory in `~/dotfiles/` corresponds to a "package" and its internal structure mirrors `$HOME`.

## Configuration Details

*   **Zsh:**
    *   The `.zshrc` is configured to use the Arch Linux system-wide installation of Oh My Zsh (`/usr/share/oh-my-zsh/`) and Powerlevel10k.
    *   It sources `~/.p10k.zsh` if it exists (generated by running `p10k configure`).
*   **Hyprland:**
    *   Config file located at `hypr/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`.
*   **Kitty:**
    *   Config file located at `kitty/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`.
    *   Currently configured with transparency/blur and Zsh as the default shell.
